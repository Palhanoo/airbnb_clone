My favorite activity is snowboarding - I lived the dream in Canada for a few years, but that's now becoming a distant memory.  I am happy settled down to life in Melbourne, which is such an awesome city (if you haven't been).

While it\u2019s still got its \u201cHustle & Bustle\u201d the magic about Melbourne is how it balances this hectic activity with the arts, sports and entertaining. Melbournian\u2019s have passion for living life and that\u2019s a major element towards Melbourne being voted as one of the world\u2019s most liveable and friendliest cities (EIU's Global Liveability Ranking)\r\n\r\nI have spent most of my life on the Mornington Peninsula (one hour south of Melbourne). I work in Melbourne\u2019s CBD and have now also moved into the city to live. I\u2019m an avid traveler, but with so many destinations still explore both in Australia and overseas. \r\nMy greatest memories of traveling are often the people you meet and the experiences that are not found on the main tourist trail. I always love talking to a local character getting that special place to visit or caf\u00e9 to dine (usually a cousin\u2019s cafe). \r\nI have now come to a stage in my life I\u2019d like to share some of Melbourne\u2019s special places with others.

We both love travelling. I always dreamed of owning a property and having a few cottages as bed and breakfasts. Now my dream has come true with my business Tailored short stays. \r\n\r\nI am a people person who just loves spoiling my guests. That's what makes Tailored short stays different. I pay attention to the details and believe it's the little extras that make all the difference. \r\n\r\nIn my spare time I love relaxing down at our little caravan by the sea. My ideal evening is relaxing in the recliner under the stars with a glass of French Champagne listening to the roar of the ocean with David by my side, our dog Billy at our feet and our boys tucked up in bed.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/c34b6234-9da8-452e-9039-bc0886867e01.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/c34b6234-9da8-452e-9039-bc0886867e01.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"South Yarra","host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"South Yarra, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia","neighbourhood":"South Yarra","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Port Phillip","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3004","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.83391363755863","longitude":"144.97292515718945","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":6,"bathrooms":2.0,"bedrooms":2,"beds":3,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Wheelchair accessible","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Elevator in building","Hot tub","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","Self Check-In","Lockbox"],"square_feet":null,"price":229,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":null,"cleaning_fee":69,"guests_included":2,"extra_people":19,"minimum_nights":2,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"today","has_availability":null,"availability_30":6,"availability_60":29,"availability_90":46,"availability_365":135,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":59,"first_review":"2016-03-20","last_review":"2017-03-26","review_scores_rating":98,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"moderate","calculated_host_listings_count":2,"reviews_per_month":4.66,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.95773268957825,-37.80925958599195]},"properties":{"id":"12419310","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/12419310","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"Comfy Studio Apartment in the CBD","summary":"My place is a fully furnished apartment close to Queen Victoria Market, Free Tram Zone, Flagstaff Gardens, Melbourne Central and Train Stations.

The first time I traveled Overseas alone was when I was 16, to the US and Canada.  I lived in the UK for 2 1\/2 years and again for 3 months last year and most of my traveling has been backpacking and used other sharing economy websites, staying on couches and letting out my couch.  I used AirBnB during my 3 week trip to New Zealand in 2013 and thought this is perfect for me living right in the heart of the city and working in Tourism and Events I can share my local knowledge with the world... one guest at a time.\r\n\r\nI work in Events Management and have worked on such exciting events as the London Olympics 2012, The Commonwealth Games, The Australian Open and the Tim Burton Exhibition Opening at ACMI.\r\n\r\nI love horse riding, travel, theatre, comedy shows, live bands and seeing and experiencing what the world has to offer.  I have traveled extensively but I am in love with Melbourne and its many faces.\r\n\r\nI am a frugal traveler and love to share my tips and there is a lot to see and do in Melbourne that is free.  I currently work in the Tourism Industry so I know this place pretty well and living in the city well, it give life a completely different flavour, I love it.\r\n\r\nWhy AirBnB?\r\nSimple as a keen traveler and loving my city I want to share it.  I live in a central location and I have had many friends across the world stay, some whom I have met on my travels, some who became friends after they stayed.\r\n\r\nAirBnB will help me stay in my apartment, living in the city can be quite expensive so by utilsing AirBnB I can continue to live in the city I love.\r\n\r\nAirBnB has helped me renovate upstairs, removing my carpet and replacing with floorboards.  Installing a custom blind of Melbourne's art centre and skyline.\r\n\r\nNext goal your stay is contributing to:  Upgrading the kitchen Kitchen.","host_response_time":"within a day","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/8523310\/profile_pic\/1384865887\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/8523310\/profile_pic\/1384865887\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":6,"host_total_listings_count":6,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.81578912561681","longitude":"144.9550669908388","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":5,"bathrooms":1.5,"bedrooms":2,"beds":4,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Kitchen","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Safety card","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"square_feet":null,"price":118,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":3800,"security_deposit":300,"cleaning_fee":65,"guests_included":4,"extra_people":35,"minimum_nights":2,"maximum_nights":300,"calendar_updated":"yesterday","has_availability":null,"availability_30":7,"availability_60":27,"availability_90":57,"availability_365":58,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":43,"first_review":"2014-11-24","last_review":"2017-03-26","review_scores_rating":94,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":2,"reviews_per_month":1.49,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Require Guest Profile Picture","Require Guest Phone Verification"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9565052817401,-37.81752021535242]},"properties":{"id":"16415588","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/16415588","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"Collins \u2013 1 Bdrm Apt *View*Pool*Gym*Spa*Sauna*","summary":"This privately owned 1-bedroom apartment will make you want to sit in front of the windows and take in the views.

Trams give you easy access to the Victoria Market at the north of the city, the Arts Centre and botanical gardens to the south, or parliament house the Paris end of Collins Street to the East.  Taxis are plentiful in the CBD, you can hail a passing taxi, and there is a taxi rank just across the road in Flinders Lane.","access":"The building has a security system to restrict access to residents and guests.

Free, unlimited Wifi is available, with superfast download speeds (see the photos). Other facilities in the building are also available for your enjoyment. Take a swim in the heated pool, relax in the spa, sweat it out in the sauna, or work out in the gym. As you are working your way through these, you may want to take a break and cook up a barbecue!","interaction":"I am recently retired, so I am available to help you enjoy your stay in Melbourne.

Southbank and the whole city precinct is a short stroll away. There is an endless array of eateries in Melbourne.  The same goes for bars.  Explore one of the many lane ways and just open the concealed door to find the hidden gems. Melbourne is a shoppers paradise.  Whether you want designer boutiques in the Paris end of town, outlet stores at harbourtown or South wharf or the Melbourne institutions, Myer and David Jones, you'll find it all within walking distance.","notes":"We have a cat so if you have a cat phobia of any sort, this probably isn't the place for you.","transit":"Being right in the centre of Melbourne there is an abundance of public transport.

We live in Melbourne Australia.  Mark works in IT and Ken is a Chiropractor.  We love to travel and in the past few years have been on trips to Europe, Middle East, US, Asia and South America.  We love cruising because it's an easy way to see cities and places of the world without having to see the inside of an airport or lug a suitcase.  In 2013 we did a Transatlantic cruise from Rome to Fort Lauderdale and another from Buenos Aires to Santiago Chile.  When on land we like to stay at b&b's, homestays or private apartments.  The knowledge of local hosts and quality of accommodation in great locations is what we look for.  Local knowledge is invaluable.  \r\n\r\nOur favourite cities and places include Rome, Berlin, Jordan (you have to go to Petra and Jarash), Bangkok, Cambodia (try the train trip from Bangkok to Cambodia), Barcelona and Santiago.  \r\nOur bucket list includes Cuba, Galapagos Islands, a Baltic cruise, more of Cambodia and lots more of Europe.  We also want to see more of the USA.   Whilst we think we've done a lot of the US we've only just scratched the surface.  Our bucket list includes driving the winnebago from West to East coast (with lots of zig zagging along the way).   \r\n\r\nKen is an avid cook and Mark an avid Collingwood (AFL) supporter.  Don't hold that against him.  We're long time Melbourne locals.  Both born in Victoria we've lived Melbourne inner city, South, East and on the Mornington Peninsula.  We've also lived in various cities around Australia (Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Mildura, Warnambool, Bright and Darwin) and have been lucky enough to experience life living overseas in New Zealand and the USA.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/20678107\/profile_pic\/1409313761\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/20678107\/profile_pic\/1409313761\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Richmond","host_listings_count":4,"host_total_listings_count":4,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","google","reviews","jumio","work_email"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.81176214327165","longitude":"144.95759082401614","property_type":"Bed & Breakfast","room_type":"Private room","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Gym","Breakfast","Pets live on this property","Cat(s)","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"square_feet":null,"price":128,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":150,"cleaning_fee":null,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":30,"minimum_nights":2,"maximum_nights":999,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":11,"availability_60":38,"availability_90":68,"availability_365":268,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":81,"first_review":"2014-10-20","last_review":"2017-03-25","review_scores_rating":99,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":3,"reviews_per_month":2.71,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9655264189207,-37.817909889129275]},"properties":{"id":"9496178","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/9496178","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"Perfect Location","summary":"This cool, light filled, recently renovated apartment is located on top of a heritage listed building directly opposite Flinders Street Station.

I love exploring new places whether it be beaches, restaurants or sports games. I have a keen interest in rugby, cricket and tennis, having played them to a sub-par standard over the years, and love to hit games whenever I can.\r\n\r\nI enjoy a wide variety of music, and consider myself a bedroom rock star on the guitar; alas no public performances have come onto the radar just yet. I developed a love for old-school rock in my younger years courtesy of my parents, and have been around the live concert ring of The Eagles, Eric Clapton, Cat Stevens etc. So I love talking and sharing experiences about music in general, if you're that way inclined!\r\n\r\nIn my unripened age, I haven't done a lot of traveling, however I have big dreams to build a list with my partner in crime, and tackle as many adventures as we can. So if you have any awesome stories of your home land or travels, an eager pair of ears aren't too far away!","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/45397e00-a0bf-407a-b9ba-1cb32fd154f6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/45397e00-a0bf-407a-b9ba-1cb32fd154f6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"East Melbourne","host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.81190553685003","longitude":"144.96621805808223","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":2,"beds":2,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Kitchen","Elevator in building","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":null,"price":130,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":300,"cleaning_fee":50,"guests_included":2,"extra_people":20,"minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"6 weeks ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":0,"availability_60":0,"availability_90":0,"availability_365":0,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":22,"first_review":"2016-11-26","last_review":"2017-02-18","review_scores_rating":95,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":9,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":2,"reviews_per_month":5.08,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.97565066375705,-37.84104013444142]},"properties":{"id":"7052052","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/7052052","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"Spacious St Kilda Rd Apartment With 2 Queen Beds","summary":"Superb location steps from St Kilda Road with 7 trams lines within 2 minutes walk and 10-15 minutes by tram to the CBD, South Melbourne, St Kilda and South Yarra.

You'll find us enjoying the latest film festivals, attending sporting events (bring on the Australian Open), trying out the latest brunch cafes, buying fresh seafood at the Queen Victoria Market and exploring our ever changing city laneways.","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/43248352\/profile_pic\/1443958738\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/43248352\/profile_pic\/1443958738\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.815971234617855","longitude":"144.96756408766117","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":2,"beds":3,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Wheelchair accessible","Kitchen","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","First aid kit","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":null,"price":210,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":null,"cleaning_fee":null,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":0,"minimum_nights":3,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"6 months ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":21,"availability_60":51,"availability_90":78,"availability_365":169,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":61,"first_review":"2015-10-10","last_review":"2017-03-25","review_scores_rating":97,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":1,"reviews_per_month":3.38,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.97021604024303,-37.817083671059756]},"properties":{"id":"10714041","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/10714041","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"*NEW Boutique Perfectly Central Apt","summary":"\"ABODE 313\" Center of MELBOURNE (Less than 3 night minimum may be available contact Rob) Interior styled apartment located within Melbourne's sports and arts precincts.

While it\u2019s still got its \u201cHustle & Bustle\u201d the magic about Melbourne is how it balances this hectic activity with the arts, sports and entertaining. Melbournian\u2019s have passion for living life and that\u2019s a major element towards Melbourne being voted as one of the world\u2019s most liveable and friendliest cities (EIU's Global Liveability Ranking)\r\n\r\nI have spent most of my life on the Mornington Peninsula (one hour south of Melbourne). I work in Melbourne\u2019s CBD and have now also moved into the city to live. I\u2019m an avid traveler, but with so many destinations still explore both in Australia and overseas. \r\nMy greatest memories of traveling are often the people you meet and the experiences that are not found on the main tourist trail. I always love talking to a local character getting that special place to visit or caf\u00e9 to dine (usually a cousin\u2019s cafe). \r\nI have now come to a stage in my life I\u2019d like to share some of Melbourne\u2019s special places with others. These are not only my places of interest but also those hidden secrets that previous guests have found and have been excited to share with us.\r\n\r\nI like to think \u201cAbode 316 & 317\u201d are special!  They are less than a year old and designed to be functional, yet have a touch of sophistication. They are fully optioned for the traveler and create that home away from home a hotel just can\u2019t offer. \r\nAccommodation can often make or break a holiday, but I know the accommodation and hospitality my apartments will add to your Melbourne experience.\r\nRob","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/23281766\/profile_pic\/1421099380\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/23281766\/profile_pic\/1421099380\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":5,"host_total_listings_count":5,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":null,"neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.817083671059756","longitude":"144.97021604024303","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":3,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Gym","Elevator in building","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","First aid kit","Safety card","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":null,"price":160,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":200,"cleaning_fee":40,"guests_included":2,"extra_people":10,"minimum_nights":3,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":3,"availability_60":20,"availability_90":43,"availability_365":129,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":67,"first_review":"2016-01-29","last_review":"2017-03-22","review_scores_rating":100,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":5,"reviews_per_month":4.65,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9734202426874,-37.812883032518]},"properties":{"id":"3139102","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/3139102","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"24th floor above Sheraton","summary":"Our stunning apartment could not be more centrally located in the Sheraton hotel overlooking Parliament House, MCG and Treasury Gardens.

It is walking distance to Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre which is also next to the Direct Factory Outlets (DFO), RMIT, Southbank Promenade, Crown Casino, Docklands Stadium, St Kilda","notes":"Here are some FAQs. I think the more information the better! ***The shower tub ceiling height will be a little low for tall people.  ***A pedestal fan is provided for hot days.

I don't recommend it because there really is no need for a car. To get to the airport, use SkyBus.  If you have 3 people or more it's usually cheaper to catch a taxi which is only 100 metres away.  SkyBus runs express between Melbourne Airport and Southern Cross Station, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

While it\u2019s still got its \u201cHustle & Bustle\u201d the magic about Melbourne is how it balances this hectic activity with the arts, sports and entertaining. Melbournian\u2019s have passion for living life and that\u2019s a major element towards Melbourne being voted as one of the world\u2019s most liveable and friendliest cities (EIU's Global Liveability Ranking)\r\n\r\nI have spent most of my life on the Mornington Peninsula (one hour south of Melbourne). I work in Melbourne\u2019s CBD and have now also moved into the city to live. I\u2019m an avid traveler, but with so many destinations still explore both in Australia and overseas. \r\nMy greatest memories of traveling are often the people you meet and the experiences that are not found on the main tourist trail. I always love talking to a local character getting that special place to visit or caf\u00e9 to dine (usually a cousin\u2019s cafe). \r\nI have now come to a stage in my life I\u2019d like to share some of Melbourne\u2019s special places with others. These are not only my places of interest but also those hidden secrets that previous guests have found and have been excited to share with us.\r\n\r\nI like to think \u201cAbode 316 & 317\u201d are special!  They are less than a year old and designed to be functional, yet have a touch of sophistication. They are fully optioned for the traveler and create that home away from home a hotel just can\u2019t offer. \r\nAccommodation can often make or break a holiday, but I know the accommodation and hospitality my apartments will add to your Melbourne experience.\r\nRob","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/23281766\/profile_pic\/1421099380\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/23281766\/profile_pic\/1421099380\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":5,"host_total_listings_count":5,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.815124845365474","longitude":"144.9700970340213","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":2.0,"bedrooms":2,"beds":2,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Gym","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","First aid kit","Safety card","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":null,"price":284,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":200,"cleaning_fee":50,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":0,"minimum_nights":3,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":10,"availability_60":39,"availability_90":57,"availability_365":133,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":88,"first_review":"2014-11-17","last_review":"2017-03-19","review_scores_rating":99,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":5,"reviews_per_month":3.04,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.96060459641956,-37.810492170122835]},"properties":{"id":"8982579","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/8982579","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"*NewExecutive in CBD Melbourne!","summary":"Perfectly located in the heart of CBD, close to Melbourne's tourist attractions, shopping, cafes, restaurants, public transport.

Be thankful with all the little miracles happening... little miracles like the raindrops, the sun rays, and the smile I see on people face.\r\n\r\nI'm an extroverted introvert. I can be alone but not feeling lonely; or I can hang out with friends and become crazy. I like to travel, shopping, sightseeing... I like to sleep in a luxurious 5-star hotel. I like mountain climbing, trekking, camping... I enjoy sleeping under the million stars in the wild. What I like most about traveling is to be able to get close to different people and culture. It never fails to amaze me. One of the most unforgettable places would be Nepal.\r\n\r\nI like to make people happy... sometimes my jokes may be dumb, but well, at least I've tried. With the Airbnb platform, I have a chance to make my guests happy too... not by cracking dumb jokes thou, but rather, giving them a clean and cosy space, and to make sure that all their needs are in place.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/35209762\/profile_pic\/1435585479\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/35209762\/profile_pic\/1435585479\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.810917431800036","longitude":"144.95686915384752","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":0,"beds":2,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Wheelchair accessible","Kitchen","Gym","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":null,"price":88,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":300,"cleaning_fee":50,"guests_included":2,"extra_people":25,"minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":15,"availability_60":40,"availability_90":67,"availability_365":307,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":61,"first_review":"2015-07-11","last_review":"2017-03-23","review_scores_rating":97,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":2,"reviews_per_month":2.89,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9669983641466,-37.811213179877164]},"properties":{"id":"16758427","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/16758427","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"Melbourne QV Fantastic Living in Premium Location","summary":"22-24 Jane Bell Lane Melbourne Please check map for the location first!

I work in Melbourne\u2019s CBD and have now also moved into the city to live. I\u2019m an avid traveler, but with so many destinations still explore both in Australia and overseas. \r\nMy greatest memories of traveling are often the people you meet and the experiences that are not found on the main tourist trail. I always love talking to a local character getting that special place to visit or caf\u00e9 to dine (usually a cousin\u2019s cafe). \r\nI have now come to a stage in my life I\u2019d like to share some of Melbourne\u2019s special places with others.

Melbourne is known for its caf\u00e9s and restaurants, and the apartment is close to plenty of both. Dine on the Yarra, visit China Town further up Little Bourke St, or enjoy authentic Italian on Lygon St (Melbourne's renown Italian district). If shopping is your thing, check out the department stores in Bourke St Mall, the factory outlets in Docklands (both are an easy tram ride inside the free tram zone), or the boutique shopping on Chapel St (3 train stops away). The 86 tram stops right outside the apartment, waiting to take you to the iconic St Kilda Beach and Luna Park. Melbourne is also known for its hidden laneway bars and quirky drinking establishments, all located an easy distance from the apartment, within the CBD. If a day adventure is your thing, drive an hour out of the city and you'll find Yarra Valley wineries, Dandenong Ranges, forest ranges, and (in winter) cross country skiing!","notes":"Located on the corner of Spencer St and Little Bourke St- an easy tram ride to China Town.

There are so many great things to do that are just a short walk away.  Some of my top tips for what to do during your stay are: - Check out South Melbourne Market - it is the cooler (and closer!) cousin to the Queen Victoria Market, hip homewares and tasty food - including the famous South Melbourne Market Dim Sims! - Hang out at cool Southbank bars and restaurants (covering all price ranges) and enjoy the lights over the Yarra River - Get a surprise from the Crown Casino flames every hour in the evening when they burn brightly and tower up into the sky (a great view of these from my balcony) - Go shopping on Bourke St (a short walk away) or find bargains at DFO South Wharf  - Stop by Degraves St for an excellent brunch or perfect coffee - Check out a sporting or music event at the MCG, Rod Laver Arena, Hisense Arena or Etihad Stadium - Be the first to find a cool laneway bar or nightspot that no one else knows about... yet!","notes":"Note that occasionally I may have a friend visit (we'll make sure we are quiet if people are sleeping), I will do my best to let you know beforehand and if you have any concerns about this please do talk to me and I can try make accommodations.  If there is anything at all during your stay that is not to your satisfaction please let me know, I would rather help and fix it to make you comfortable than find out after your stay.","transit":"My apartment is very close to many tram routes and all CBD trams are now free and within walking distance to the two major train stations Flinders St station and Southern Cross Station.  The apartment is a two block walk from where the airport bus (Skybus) terminates at Southern Cross station.  If you need any help, just ask! I can help you plan a route to get pretty much anywhere in Melbourne. In the carpark beneath the building there are two GoGet cars which can be used for short term rental, you can find out information about how to use and book them on their website (I haven't used GoGet personally, but I hear they can be a good alternative to hiring a car for your whole stay - and you don't have to pay parking!)","access":"As I have my own en-suite you will have sole use of the main bathroom which includes laundry facilities and is located right next to the guest bedroom. The bedroom contains very large built in robes with some wire draws and hangers available.  I have high speed Wi-Fi which you are welcome to use and extensive kitchen, laundry facilities and appliances. The balcony offers a great view over Southbank, you are very welcome to use it, just be careful opening the door it is very heavy (double glazed for soundproofing) and I don't want you to hurt yourself.","interaction":"Hi, my name is Katie, this apartment is my home and I treat it with great care and hope you will too. I work during weekdays and often go out at night so you will have the space to yourself but I do like to share the living area and kitchen when I am home (you may be lucky and catch me in a cake-baking mood).  I am very happy to offer suggestions on the best ways to experience Melbourne and what it has to offer, I have lived here my whole life and know some great secret places.","house_rules":"No smoking or pets please.

I like to watch movies and play video games. Sometimes I could spend my whole day in my room just play games. I thought that there isn't much things to do outside and I thought the World was a boring place. When I'm not playing games, I would read news on the internet just to catch up with the rest of the world. That's how I knew Airbnb. \r\n\r\nOne day, my father come to me, talked about doing short term renting. He has got few new apartments that our relatives bought which needs to be rented out. I told him about Airbnb and he thought we could really make it work. So I asked my best friend if he is interested to be my partner for this, and he said yes. We started almost immediately, planning, buying furnitures to started taking guests in just two weeks. \r\n\r\nThen it really changed me.\r\n\r\nI met with travellers around the world. Every body was so polite and friendly.  When I talk to them I can feel the excitement and happiness. It's totally  different compare to what I thought people are like. Maybe because this communicate is great, I don't know.  Then I  thought \"I want to be people like my guests\". I want people around me to feel life is great and there are a lot to look forward to. The guests really gave me a lot motivation towards my work and my life. Here I have to thank you all.\r\n\r\nAfter one month, the revenue was great, however take away the interests and loans, all kinds of fees and salary for my partner, there are really not much left for me. But I think that's enough, I'm still a student, I have to spend time on study and don't have much things to spend money on anyway, being able to save money for a holiday with my girl friend every few month is perfect for me. \r\n\r\nAfter all these experience, I felt it really changed my life and how I view the world. Doesn't matter if I fail or succeed it's  going to effect the rest of my life in a very positive way, that's something really valuable to me.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/1856890e-dd44-4280-803c-0cf8d111eb1d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/pictures\/1856890e-dd44-4280-803c-0cf8d111eb1d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"St Kilda","host_listings_count":8,"host_total_listings_count":8,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","government_id"],"street":"St Kilda, Melbourne, VIC 3182, Australia","neighbourhood":"St Kilda","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Port Phillip","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"Victoria","zipcode":"3182","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.8563726551873","longitude":"144.98349082588308","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Wheelchair accessible","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Gym","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","Self Check-In","Doorman Entry"],"square_feet":null,"price":109,"weekly_price":800,"monthly_price":3300,"security_deposit":200,"cleaning_fee":30,"guests_included":3,"extra_people":15,"minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"today","has_availability":null,"availability_30":7,"availability_60":26,"availability_90":56,"availability_365":331,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":86,"first_review":"2015-09-26","last_review":"2017-03-26","review_scores_rating":95,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":6,"reviews_per_month":4.64,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.96773679540019,-37.80893290953344]},"properties":{"id":"16909128","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/16909128","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"1BR 1BTH Lavish Luxury in Heart of Melbourne","summary":"This is the most affordable, luxurious, and spacious apartment in the Heart of Melbourne.

Rob and I were thrilled to be invited to conduct 2 host educator workshops. \n\nMy travel interests include meeting social entrepreneurs who run social enterprises\/not for profits to create social change, and volunteer travel (voluntourism). \n\nSampling local food, urban\/cultural sites and natural attractions and chillaxing with a good book and meeting inspirational folks are some of the highlights of my recent trips.\r\n \n\r\nWe enjoy travelling independently and with friends and I am curious about the world and very open minded. I love visiting friends around the world and meeting local people. Small group travel is a recent new and has been a very positive experience.\r\n\r\nMelbourne is a very culturally diverse city, and offers amazing food and cultural experiences from across the globe. There are wonderful cultural events (many for free) and restaurants to explore. I am very resourceful and can help connect you with anything\/place or interest you have. \r\n\r\nMy professional background is in the tourism industry. I have held a variety of roles including guest relations for Ayers Rock Resort, to being a german speaking tour guide at Ayers Rock (Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park) and operating tours for gay and lesbian international travellers and cruise ship excursions. \r\n\r\nI have hosted friends and family and friends of friends for many years. I provide a welcoming space for guests to relax, reflect, experience and recharge.\r\n\r\nMy other role involves running workshops in governance, strategic planning and risk for not for proift organisations which is very rewarding. Weekends for me are best spent with my partner Rob in a local cafe, reading, planning our next trips, walking and spending time with friends. My friends are an eclectic bunch from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, faiths, sexualities and lifestyles. \r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do.

Located right in the centre of the city there's everything on your doorstep.  The Queen Victoria Market is a short 5 minute walk.  Sporting venues such as Etihad Stadium, the MCG (AFL football, cricket), AAMI Park (soccer, rugby) and Melbourne Park \/ Rod Laver Arena (Tennis, concerts etc) are within walking distance or catch a tram.  Southbank and the whole city precinct is a short stroll away. There is an endless array of eateries in Melbourne.  The same goes for bars.  Explore one of the many lane ways and just open the concealed door to find the hidden gems. Melbourne is a shoppers paradise.  Whether you want designer boutiques in the Paris end of town, outlet stores at harbourtown or South wharf or the Melbourne institutions, Myer and David Jones, you'll find it all within walking distance.","notes":"We have a cat so if you have a cat phobia of any sort, this probably isn't the place for you.","transit":"Being right in the centre of Melbourne there is an abundance of public transport.  We are seconds from Flagstaff train station, which is one of the Melbourne city loop underground stations.

For those with a car, there is car parking at Harbour Town (next to the Melbourne Observation Wheel).  The car park is open 24 hours with the maximum charge of 10 per 24 hour period.

We live in Melbourne Australia.  Mark works in IT and Ken is a Chiropractor.  We love to travel and in the past few years have been on trips to Europe, Middle East, US, Asia and South America.  We love cruising because it's an easy way to see cities and places of the world without having to see the inside of an airport or lug a suitcase.  In 2013 we did a Transatlantic cruise from Rome to Fort Lauderdale and another from Buenos Aires to Santiago Chile.  When on land we like to stay at b&b's, homestays or private apartments.  The knowledge of local hosts and quality of accommodation in great locations is what we look for.  Local knowledge is invaluable.  \r\n\r\nOur favourite cities and places include Rome, Berlin, Jordan (you have to go to Petra and Jarash), Bangkok, Cambodia (try the train trip from Bangkok to Cambodia), Barcelona and Santiago.  \r\nOur bucket list includes Cuba, Galapagos Islands, a Baltic cruise, more of Cambodia and lots more of Europe.  We also want to see more of the USA.   Whilst we think we've done a lot of the US we've only just scratched the surface.  Our bucket list includes driving the winnebago from West to East coast (with lots of zig zagging along the way).   \r\n\r\nKen is an avid cook and Mark an avid Collingwood (AFL) supporter.  Don't hold that against him.  We're long time Melbourne locals.  Both born in Victoria we've lived Melbourne inner city, South, East and on the Mornington Peninsula.  We've also lived in various cities around Australia (Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Mildura, Warnambool, Bright and Darwin) and have been lucky enough to experience life living overseas in New Zealand and the USA.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/20678107\/profile_pic\/1409313761\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/20678107\/profile_pic\/1409313761\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Richmond","host_listings_count":4,"host_total_listings_count":4,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","google","reviews","jumio","work_email"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.81102452040303","longitude":"144.9556574323463","property_type":"Bed & Breakfast","room_type":"Private room","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Gym","Breakfast","Pets live on this property","Cat(s)","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"square_feet":null,"price":119,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":150,"cleaning_fee":null,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":30,"minimum_nights":2,"maximum_nights":999,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":11,"availability_60":36,"availability_90":64,"availability_365":264,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":86,"first_review":"2014-11-17","last_review":"2017-04-01","review_scores_rating":99,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"strict","calculated_host_listings_count":3,"reviews_per_month":2.97,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.95701764257043,-37.818363484525044]},"properties":{"id":"8257712","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/8257712","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"Melbourne CBD Gem","summary":"This lovely studio apartment is in a great Collins Street location for your next visit to Melbourne - central, quiet and private with Melbourne at your fingertips!","space":"This modern, open plan studio apartment is in a great location on Collins Street \u2013 in the free tram zone so the city is at your fingertips!

Please be careful.","interaction":"I respond to Airbnb messages immediately, and am always available if you want tips, advice or help. Otherwise, I'll leave you to enjoy the apartment as if it is your own, and Melbourne as if you live here.","house_rules":"Please take good care of the apartment, it's fixtures and fittings, and report any damage or concerns as soon as they are evident.

Please turn lights and heater or air-con off as you leave, take all your things and leave the apartment as close as possible to the state you found it in.

While it\u2019s still got its \u201cHustle & Bustle\u201d the magic about Melbourne is how it balances this hectic activity with the arts, sports and entertaining. Melbournian\u2019s have passion for living life and that\u2019s a major element towards Melbourne being voted as one of the world\u2019s most liveable and friendliest cities (EIU's Global Liveability Ranking)\r\n\r\nI have spent most of my life on the Mornington Peninsula (one hour south of Melbourne). I work in Melbourne\u2019s CBD and have now also moved into the city to live. I\u2019m an avid traveler, but with so many destinations still explore both in Australia and overseas. \r\nMy greatest memories of traveling are often the people you meet and the experiences that are not found on the main tourist trail. I always love talking to a local character getting that special place to visit or caf\u00e9 to dine (usually a cousin\u2019s cafe). \r\nI have now come to a stage in my life I\u2019d like to share some of Melbourne\u2019s special places with others.

It has been a great experience so far and I have been having so much fun while travelling or hosting. \r\n\r\nA bit of myself... I am a working professional engineer who has worked and lived in South America, USA & Australia. I am normally very busy and spend a lot of time out the apartment. I am currently studying a Master Degree and have a busy schedule during the whole week from early morning until late in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nI enjoy socializing, however I am also very respectful of other's privacy. I have also done a bit of traveling in the past 10 years within 4 continents visiting around 15 countries. I believe in having a balance in life enjoying it and living it to the fullest! \r\n\r\nI love travelling, dancing Latin music, basketball and anything related with outdoors activities.\r\n\r\nI am very passionate with everything I do and always try my best.  I also enjoy business and believe in good service and customer satisfaction. \r\n\r\nLife is too short! \"Eat dessert first\"\r\n\r\nErnesto!\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant points to note:\r\n\r\n- I am VERY COMMITTED to respond my messages and sort things out as quick as possible.

It's home. \r\n\r\nBorn in the USA,  my family moved to Germany at a young age where we stayed for nine years before moving to Australia when I was in my early teens. \r\n\r\nI have experience in hospitality having worked full time for two years as Concierge in one of Melbourne's 5 star hotels. \r\n\r\nMy husband was also born overseas - in Bucharest, Romania.  \r\nAfter escaping the former communist regime, he lived in both Germany and France before finally settling in Australia in his early 20's. \r\n\r\nBoth of us, having lived in many different countries as well as having traveled a bit, love exploring and experiencing a new place.  We also appreciate the importance what a great location and amenity can offer when visiting a place for a while or a short time. \r\n\r\nBetween us we can speak 5 languages - English, German, Romanian, French and Italian to varying levels of ability, if it helps you out. \r\n\r\nWe hope you book in and enjoy your stay in our cool apartment and get to love our adopted city of Melbourne as much as we do.\r\n\r\nBoth of us are rowing Commonwealth Games Gold and Olympic Bronze medalists - ironically.....for Australia.   \r\n\r\nRowing is still very much part of our lives.  We're very active in the local rowing community and operate the only private rowing school in Australia called Rowing School Victoria - it's been located on the stunning Yarra River since 2007.    We love it.\r\n\r\nWe're generally up and about or nearby the apartment.  We spend quite a bit of time coaching our rowing students as we ride our bikes alongside them on the stretch of river that runs from Princes Bridge in the City, to just past Chapel Street, South Yarra.    \r\n\r\nWe'll be easily available via mobile, email, text or in person if needed.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/26090745\/profile_pic\/1421228849\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/26090745\/profile_pic\/1421228849\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews","jumio","government_id","work_email"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.81714009534352","longitude":"144.96742313324629","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":4,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":2,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Doorman","Breakfast","Elevator in building","Heating","Family\/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Lock on bedroom door","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace"],"square_feet":null,"price":125,"weekly_price":null,"monthly_price":null,"security_deposit":300,"cleaning_fee":50,"guests_included":2,"extra_people":15,"minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":365,"calendar_updated":"today","has_availability":null,"availability_30":7,"availability_60":26,"availability_90":52,"availability_365":317,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":58,"first_review":"2016-06-15","last_review":"2017-04-02","review_scores_rating":98,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"moderate","calculated_host_listings_count":1,"reviews_per_month":5.94,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact","Instant Bookable"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.95833727747168,-37.816348007585454]},"properties":{"id":"17123421","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/17123421","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-03","name":"2 bedroom apartment in City Melbourne","summary":"The apartment is located right in the heart of one of Australia's most vibrant and exotic cities.

We have a comprehensive guide of how to access the keys (with photos) and how to get in, so if that is something you'd like to use we can email through a guide to you. Also, in the case of longer bookings we like to do a once a month general maintenance pop-in at a mutually agreeable time, just to water the plants, clean a few filters and make sure the place is functioning at its best etc. at no extra cost to the guests.","transit":"This is an ideal location to get anywhere and everywhere you could possibly need!

If you're keen to explore the city on foot, a journey to Federation Square is less than 20 minutes walk - if you aren't tempted to stop by Melbourne's famous laneways, cafes, and shops along the way.   Additionally we highly recommend exploring the city via RACV\u2019s bike rental system.

We hope you do too.  I have been a nurse\/midwife for over 30 years and Phil has been a fire officer for just as long.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment is fully self contained but we rarely cook. Why would you when there are so many dining choices only a few minutes away?  We enjoy being able to walk to all the city attractions, or catch the free tram if we're feeling lazy.  As we near retirement we look forward to more holidays and travel which will obviously include France. (Again!)  Our ideal holiday involves minimal moves from place to place and soaking up the local culture.  Days are planned around the best local eateries.  \r\n\r\nIf by some chance one of us cannot greet you on arrival, our daughter Justine who lives a few minutes away will happily welcome you.  Please contact us if you have any questions about the apartment, or if you need assistance with activities in Melbourne.\r\n\r\nPhil has recently retired and has been delegated most of the greeting duties.\r\n\r\nWarmest Regards\r\n\r\nHeather & Phil","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":100,"host_acceptance_rate":null,"host_thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/3969797\/profile_pic\/1351144071\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/im\/users\/3969797\/profile_pic\/1351144071\/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Central Business District","host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","government_id"],"street":"Central Business District, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia","neighbourhood":"Central Business District","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Melbourne","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":null,"city":"Melbourne","state":"VIC","zipcode":"3000","market":"Melbourne","smart_location":"Melbourne, Australia","country_code":"AU","country":"Australia","latitude":"-37.81592479200562","longitude":"144.9616686946181","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home\/apt","accommodates":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bed_type":"Real Bed","amenities":["TV","Wireless Internet","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Elevator in building","Buzzer\/wireless intercom","Heating","Washer","Smoke detector","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"square_feet":null,"price":135,"weekly_price":840,"monthly_price":2800,"security_deposit":250,"cleaning_fee":null,"guests_included":1,"extra_people":0,"minimum_nights":4,"maximum_nights":1125,"calendar_updated":"a week ago","has_availability":null,"availability_30":0,"availability_60":0,"availability_90":0,"availability_365":0,"calendar_last_scraped":"2017-04-03","number_of_reviews":25,"first_review":"2015-09-08","last_review":"2017-03-29","review_scores_rating":98,"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"license":null,"jurisdiction_names":null,"cancellation_policy":"moderate","calculated_host_listings_count":1,"reviews_per_month":1.31,"features":["Host Is Superhost","Host Has Profile Pic","Host Identity Verified","Is Location Exact"]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.95342350710305,-37.81478401541664]},"properties":{"id":"15790599","listing_url":"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/rooms\/15790599","scrape_id":"20170403112154","last_scraped":"2017-04-04","name":"LV 42 PREMIUM DESIGNER 1BDR +SOUTHERN CROSS +WIFI","summary":"Premium 1BDR+1BATHR apartment located in the heart of Melbourne.

EVERYTHING is within walking distance. Just a short stroll to: - the Arts Centre - Hamer Hall - Federation Square - Flinders Street Station - Southern Cross Station - Queen Victoria Markets - Melbourne Sealife Aquarium - Southbank  - Degraves Street Trams at the doorstep and easy access to all the cafes, graffiti lane-ways and boutique shops Melbourne is world famous for. It doesn't get more central to the action than this! My top tip? Find a balance between planning excursions and spontaneous adventures. Melbourne is known for it's street performers, graffiti artists and pop up shops and cafes. As much as you can research and plan in advance, many of the best experiences my guests have had have happened when they weren't expecting them! Make sure you leave some time for aimlessly wandering around the city and discovering unexpected gems!","notes":null,"transit":"Trains: - 8-minute walk to Flinders Street Station - 9-minute walk to Southern Cross Station Trams: - right outside the apartment, there's a tram station with trams departing every few minutes. Uber: - quickly replacing taxis here in Melbourne, an uber driver is never more than 10 minutes away and is usually that fastest way to get where you need to go! Bike Hire: - there is a City of Melbourne bike hire stand right outside the apartment. Biking is a beautiful way of getting around the city with a lot of bike lines and special bike tracks along the beach and river. Airport Transfers: - I recommend using Skybus.
